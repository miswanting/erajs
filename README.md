- Carefully set up the API so that game developers can worry less about things that have nothing to do with content or gameplay;
- [WIP] All code cross-platform;
- The development environment, packaging and deployment must be simple and reliable;
- Be friendly to re-development;
- In principle, do not cut off any functionality provided by the technology used.
- Use the latest technology.
